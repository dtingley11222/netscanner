# Network Scanner

Network Scanner is a Python script that uses Scapy to scan a specified IP range and discover devices on the network.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the script, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You will also need to install the required libraries. You can install them using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For Windows users, you may need to install Npcap separately to enable packet capturing. You can download Npcap from npcap.org.

# Getting Started

# Usage

```python netscan.py```


The script will scan the specified IP range and display the available devices on the network.
