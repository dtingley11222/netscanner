# Network Scanner

Network Scanner is a Python script that uses Scapy to scan a specified IP range and discover devices on the network.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the required libraries. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

For Windows users, you may need to install Npcap separately to enable packet capturing. You can download Npcap from npcap.org.

Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-scanner.git
cd network-scanner

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the script and enter the target IP address range when prompted.

python network_scanner.py


Saving Output
The script allows you to save the scan results to a text file. After scanning, you will be prompted if you want to save the output to output.txt.
